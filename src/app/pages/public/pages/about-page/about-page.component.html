      <span class="text" i18n>
        Sasha is the way everybody calls me, even if it's far away from my official name - Oleksandr - but it's
        definetly easyier.

        I was born in Bila Tzerkva, a city 80km south of Kiev, the 16 may 2002.

        I fall in love with development during the third year of computer science in ITIS C.Zuccante, thanks to my
        computer science teacher.
      </span>
      <span class="text" i18n>
        From there, my life changed. I started practicing something I actually liked with good results.
      </span>
      <span class="text" i18n>
        I am constantly searching for new ideas and ways to improve my code and software.

        I graduated in Computer Science from the Carlo Zuccante Institute in Mestre Venice.
        I will start studying Information Science at Ca' Foscari University of Venice in September 2023.
        The idea is to complete the three-year degree in Information Science and then pursue a master's degree in
        Computer Security.

        I currently work as a web developer at Demetra Opinioni.net Srl since March 2021.
        However, I started working at a very young age,
        as I have always been fond of freedom and independence.

      <span class="text" i18n>
        I learned the basics of computer science at ITIS C.Zuccante,
        a high school for computer science students.
        During those years, I worked with PHP, mySQL, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Dart, and some Java.
        I started working at Demetra Opinioni.net a few months before graduating, and I learned a lot, which I was then
        able to apply to my final exams.
        At work, I have also learned Ruby, TypeScript, SCSS, and PostgreSQL.
        I also know a couple frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Angular, Yii, and Flutter

      <span class="text" i18n>
        The truth is that I love doing many things, I'm very open-minded and extremely ambitious.
        I can briefly mention some of my passions, so as not to bore you.
      </span>

      <span class="text" i18n>
        I love cars, motorcycles, and extreme sports.
        Anything that can give me an adrenaline rush is a hobby of mine.
        I believe that adrenaline is one of the truest sensations that life can give us.
      </span>

      <span class="text" i18n>
        I love animals.
        I love all animals, and maybe in another life, I would have been a veterinarian.
        Animals are never fake, they never say one thing and mean another,
        and they are always genuine and straightforward.
        I have two cats: Tom, an 8-year-old ginger cat, and Kikka, a 4-year-old Siamese kitten.
      </span>

      <span class="text" i18n>
        I love learning new things.
        "Curiosity is everything" is a phrase that I fully endorse.
        Sometimes, I even get chills when I discover something new thanks to a documentary or a book.
      </span>

      <span class="text" i18n>
        I love sports.
        Sports are a wonderful thing.
        They allow us to test our skills while doing something that is good for our body and soul.
        Let's face it, who doesn't feel more relaxed after a good workout?
        I practiced karate for 4 years, swimming for another 2, and I've been doing bodybuilding since I was 14 years
        old.
      </span>

      <span class="text" i18n>
        I love my family.
        Okay, maybe it's not a hobby, but I talked about all the things I love, and I couldn't not talk about my family.
        My mother took me away from my hometown (Bila Tzerkva, Ukraine) when I was 7 years old, to give me a better life
        here in Italy.
        Alone, without education, without knowing the language, and with a child to take care of, she managed, after
        many years of sacrifice, to buy a house that was all ours.
        There is no woman in the world who is stronger than her.
        She taught me what sacrifice and hard work are.
